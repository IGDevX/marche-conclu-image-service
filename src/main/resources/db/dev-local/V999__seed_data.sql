-- Seed data for local development
-- Note: Seed data is now managed by ImageSeeder.java
-- which generates and uploads real images to MinIO on startup
--
-- This file exists to maintain Flyway structure but no longer inserts data.
-- Images are dynamically created by ImageSeeder with real images uploaded to MinIO.
